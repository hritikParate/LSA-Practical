##Install samba to share folder or files between windows and linux

Theory:
Samba is a powerful suite of applications that provides an open source implementation of the Server Message Block/Common Internet File System (SMB/CIFS) protocol.
Among other things, Samba helps Linux-based systems interoperate with Windows-based operating systems.
Samba transparently provides file and print sharing services to Windows clients as well as other networked clients running other operating systems.
It does this through the use of the native Microsoft networking protocols SMB/CIFS. From a system administrator’s point of view,
this means you can deploy a Linux-based server and use it to 
provide file-sharing, authentication, print, and other services to other non-native Linux clients such as Microsoft Windows systems.
Using Samba means that Windows systems can use their native tongue to talk to the Linux server—which means fewer hassles for you and seamless integration for your users.

STEPS:

install samba
#sudo apt-get install samba

Create Shared folder named "samba_shared"
#mkdir samba_shared 

create files to share in this path /home/kali/samba_shared 
#cd /home/kali/samba_shared
#touch a.txt b.txt c.txt

#cd /etc/samba
#ls /etc/samba
#cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp (for backup)

open smb.conf in the text editor
#sudo nano smb.conf

delete all the content in smb.conf 
and then write:
[Samba_Shared]
   comment =Welcome to samba
   path = /home/kali/samba_shared
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes

then save it.

download smbclient 
#sudo apt-get install smb-client

#sudo systemctl start smbd
#sudo systemctl stop nmbd
check the status
#sudo systemctl status smbd

#whoami command
# sudo pdbedit -a -u $(whoami)
Enter your passwd
#sudo pdbedit -L (to check all users)
#sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 (or24 my ip was 168.52.128/24) to any app Samba
(this will make any connectionn possible to connect)
check for your ip too : ip a or ip addr
#sudo ufw reload  (will reload your firewall)
you can check your working or not by :
#sudo smbcllient -U <username>(mine is kali) -L  //your ip
you can also try restarting your smbd and nmbd
#sudo systemctl restart smbd/nmbd
and then check their status'
then copy your ip addr and then paste in windows 10's  run option.
